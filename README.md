# Nuxeo Imaging Recompute

This is a simple plugin used to recompute the picture views of a Picture.

## Usage

On the summary of a Picture, a new action is available to recompute its picture views.

On the Admin Center, a new section "Imaging" is available in which an administrator can launch the recomputation of a set of Picture through a NXQL query. The recomputation is done in an asynchronous way.
